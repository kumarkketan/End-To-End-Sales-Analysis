This project focuses on end-to-end sales data analysis using Python (Pandas) for data cleaning and preprocessing, followed by MySQL for structured data storage, constraint implementation, and insightful query-based analysis.

**Project Overview**

The goal of this project was to clean and analyze raw sales data collected across different files and transform it into actionable business insights. The process involved several critical data analytics steps, including data wrangling, data integration, database design, and SQL-based data exploration.

**Data Cleaning (Python & Pandas)**

Cleaned and standardized data from 9 different CSV files using Python and the Pandas library.

Performed tasks like:

  â€¢ Handling missing values

  â€¢ Removing duplicates

  â€¢ Renaming inconsistent columns

  â€¢ Changing data types for compatibility

  â€¢ Formatting date and time fields

  â€¢ Merged all cleaned datasets into structured DataFrames ready for ingestion into a relational database.


Data Ingestion & MySQL Schema Design

  â€¢ Created a MySQL database and designed relational tables with appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and auto-increment columns to ensure data integrity.

  â€¢ Imported the cleaned data from Python into MySQL using SQLAlchemy and MySQL connector.

  â€¢ Defined entity-relationship structure based on the logical relationships among customers, products, transactions, and categories.


ðŸ“Š SQL-Based Data Analysis

Solved various business-oriented queries to extract insights such as:

  â€¢ Total and average sales

  â€¢ Top-performing products and categories

  â€¢ Month-over-month growth

  â€¢ Customer purchase behavior

  â€¢ Region-wise performance

Applied aggregate functions, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, JOINs, subqueries, and window functions for advanced analysis.


Key Outcomes

  â€¢ Successfully transformed unstructured raw data into a clean, relational dataset.

  â€¢ Designed a robust and scalable data model in MySQL.

  â€¢ Derived meaningful insights to help understand sales trends, customer preferences, and operational efficiency.

  â€¢ Demonstrated proficiency in Python for data manipulation and SQL for analytical problem-solving.
